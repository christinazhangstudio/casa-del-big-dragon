# Creating a DokuWiki

2. Download nginx (though any server would do, Apache, IIS, OpenBSD, etc.) and php (needed for FastCGI)
3. Download Dokuwiki and extract to www/ in root folder of nginx
3. Put extracted php/ in root folder of nginx
3. Download start-nginx.exe/start-nginx.ini for nice Windows GUI so that you don't need to manually run php-cgi.exe and start nginx separately at the same time
4. cook nginx.conf:


```conf
worker_processes  1;
# single threaded process. Generally set to be equal to the number of CPUs or cores.

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
    # worker_processes and worker_connections allows you to calculate maxclients value: 
    # max_clients = worker_processes * worker_connections
}

http {
    include       mime.types;
    # anything written in /opt/nginx/conf/mime.types is interpreted as if written inside the http { } block

    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    sendfile        on;
    # If serving locally stored static files, sendfile is essential to speed up the server,
    # But if using as reverse proxy one can deactivate it
    
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    # timeout during which a keep-alive client connection will stay open.

    server {
        # You would want to make a separate file with its own server block for each virtual domain
        # on your server and then include them.
        
```
